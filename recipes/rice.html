    <h1>Rice</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rice is an important part of food culture around the world, but nowhere is it more quintessential than in Asian cuisine. There isn't "correct" one way to make rice, but if you have never made it before you might be surprised that your results are not what you expected. In this recipe we will got over a fool proof way to make perfectly fluffy rice everytime.</p>
        <p>The first thing you might notice is that the Tiger Rice Cooker is on the ingredients list. This is because cooking rice without a rice cooker comes with too many variables, from pot sizes to stove temperatures, that consistency is not possible across different kitchens. Tiger is the most trusted brand of rice cookers in Asia. So before you begin, get a Tiger rice cooker.</p>
        <p>One a side note, there are many different types of rice, all of which has subtle differences in texture and flavor. If you are a beginner, it doesn't really matter which one you use, they all cook almost the same way. I recommend getting Jasmine rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>Rice</ul>
        <ul>Water</ul>
        <ul>Tiger Rice Cooker</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 1/2 cup of rice per person (or 1 cup per person if you're really hungry) into the Tiger pot. Wash the rice thoroughly, filling the rice pot with water, mixing the rice, and draining the water multiple times. Do this until the water is nearly clear after mixing.</li>
            <li>After the water is clear, fill the pot with water until rice is completely submerged.</li>
            <li>Use the finger test to determine the right amount of water needed. To do this, place the pot of rice and water on a flat surface and swish around until the rice settles evenly on the bottom. Then put your index finger into the water until the tip of your finger touches the top layer of rice. The water should come up to the base of your finger nail. No more, no less.</li>
            <li>After you have confirmed you have 1 fingernail length of water above your rice, place the pot into the rice cooker and press the tab down to put into cook mode (or follow instructions on digital display). A red light should display on most devices to indicate cooking.</li>   
            <li>At this point you just have to wait. Most people start the rice first in their cooking process and then make other dishes as the rice cooks.</li>    
            <li>When the rice is finished the rice cooker will click (or make a noise on digital rice cooker) and the light will go from red to yellow. At this point, carefully open the rice cooker, making sure not to avoid the steam cloud. Check the rice. There should be no more excess water and the rice should be firm, but tender. If the rice is mushy, you put to much water, if the rice is dry you didn't put enough. If you followed the finger technique correctly, it should be good to go.</li>
            <li>Using the rice ladel that comes with the rice cooker, fluff the rice, bring rice from the bottom of the pot to the top. </li>
            <li>Keep the rice in the rice cooker with the lid down. It will keep the rice heated. Scoop to plate when ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
